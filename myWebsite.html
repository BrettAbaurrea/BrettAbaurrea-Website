                <p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve always been interested in figuring out how things worked.
                    Whether that meant taking apart my electronics, or pursuing an educatiion in computer science
                    to learn how to make technology do what I wanted it to. While in Oregon I dove more into 
                    learning how things worked in a different way by joining my university's television station
                    as a production assistant, where I worked in a team to produce a weekly live television broadcast<br>
                    <br>Not only do I enjoy investigating the behind the scenes of how things work, I'm also quite fond of
                    being the “hidden reason why” things worked the way they did as well.
                    During my internship at Disneyland, I worked as a food prep, and although guests couldn’t always see me,
                    I loved knowing that without us in the background, everything would come to a halt. I love being the
                    foundation and support as opposed to being in the spotlight, despite having multiple years of experience as an actor.<br>
                    <br>When not out learning what make things tick, I can be found hiking in one of Goergia's gorgeous parks, rewatching the
                    latest Marvel movie, or just catching up on my latest podcast obsession.
